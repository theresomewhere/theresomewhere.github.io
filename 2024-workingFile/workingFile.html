            <h3 class="">Projects</h3>
            <p class="modal-grey-left">During much of the past 2 years, I worked with a large tech industry leader on a of variety Search and search-related rapid research studies.</p>

            <p class="modal-grey-left">I conducted over 40 studies during this time that involved foundational and directional research methodologies to drive product decisions. Methodologies included in-depth interviews, user-testing, journey-mapping, and literature reviews.</p>

            <p class="modal-grey-left">Studies varied from understanding user mental models of LLM chatbots, the impact of generative AI augmented search results on trust, how virtual assistants impacted search journeys, and how search results impacted users seeking information about elections.</p>

            


            <h3 class="">Project Scope</h3>
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Client:</strong> tech industry leader</p>
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Goal:</strong> provide UX feedback from first external participants pre &amp; post launch of LLM AI chatbot</p>
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Audience:</strong> UX design team working with engineering at launch</p>
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Scope:</strong> iterative weekly directional studies</p>

            <!-- Portfolio Modal - Text -->
            <p class="modal-dialog-quote-big"><em>"Show us how real people break it, so we can fix it before launch."</em></p>

            <h3 class="">Methodology</h3>
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>In-person in-depth interviews:</strong> ~40 participants with varying experience levels with LLM chatbots. Participants included tech-savvy early adopters while others had limited to no experience with chatbots</p>
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Iterative focus:</strong> learn how people interact with LLM chatbots, perform a competitive analysis, map user journeys, and discover mental models</p>

            <h3 class="">Key Findings</h3>
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Assumption:</strong> users expect more than search from an AI chat tool</p>
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Reality:</strong> participants expected more than search, however, were not prepared to effectively interact in an open-ended conversation with the chatbot</p>

            <!--<p class="modal-dialog-quote-big"><em>"If my outfits are on a cross-Atlantic ship, they're not being worn by my customers."</em></p>-->
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Assumption:</strong> users would interact conversationally with the chatbot</p>
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Reality:</strong> open-ended conversations revealed limitations for purpose-driven tasks as participants were not prepared to drive the conversation and expressed the desire for more guidance from the chatbot</p>
            <!-- Portfolio Modal - Text -->
            <!--<p class="modal-dialog-quote-big"><em>"It feels like the site is more interested in selling promoted products instead of learning what my business needs."</em></p>-->
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Assumption:</strong> interacting with a chat tool requires different interactions than a search omni-box</p>
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Reality:</strong> expectations of keyboard shortcut interactions were undermined by confusion from participants expecting to point and click</p>

            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Assumption:</strong> users had realistic use-cases for an AI chatbot</p>
            <p class="modal-grey-left"><strong>Reality:</strong> Some participants demonstrated writing assistance tasks and/or searching for recipes. Other participants expected the chatbot to solve problems and were surprised to learn of the chatbot's limitations</p>

            <p class="modal-grey-left">I'll never forget the excitement and joy participants with no AI chatbot experience shared after receiving a particularly effective response to a prompt.<br><br>Experiencing how skeptical participants became animated at the possibilities of a tool that was about to roll out the gate was wonderful feeback to be able to share with the teams working so hard to bring to launch.</p>
